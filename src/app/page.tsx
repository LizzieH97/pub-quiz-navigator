            Hi! I'm Lizzie and I am a massive quiz lover. I have always had an
            issue with pub quizzes - why is there so little information about
            days and locations on the internet? So I decided to fix that myself
            - here's a pub quiz locator for the Liverpool City Region! We have
            all the information you'll need to find a pub quiz on a night that
            suits you ðŸ¥³
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl p-7 col-start-3 col-end-7 row-start-2 mt-50 text-cream">
            Disclaimer: In the past I've turned up to pub quizzes advertised
            online (e.g. on Facebook) and the quiz has just not happened - I'm
            going to try my best and get reliable information directly from the
            pubs themselves but I can't make guarantees!
          </p>
