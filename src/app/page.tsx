              I'm Lizzie and I am a massive quiz lover. I have always had an
              issue with pub quizzes - why is there so little information about
              days and locations on the internet? So I decided to fix that
              myself - here's a pub quiz locator for the Liverpool City Region!
              We have all the information you'll need to find a pub quiz on a
              night that suits you ðŸ¥³

              Disclaimer: In the past I've turned up to pub quizzes advertised
              online (e.g. on Facebook) and the quiz has just not happened - I'm
              going to try my best and get reliable information directly from
              the pubs themselves but I can't make guarantees!
