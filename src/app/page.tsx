            Hi! I'm Lizzie and I am a massive quiz lover. I have always had an
            issue with pub quizzes - why is there so little information about
            days and locations on the internet? So I decided to fix that myself
            - here's a pub quiz locator for the Liverpool City Region! We have
            all the information you'll need to find a pub quiz on a night that
            suits you ðŸ¥³
            <br />
            <br />
            <span className="text-xl">
              Disclaimer: In the past I've turned up to pub quizzes advertised
              online (e.g. on Facebook) and the quiz has just not happened - I'm
              going to try my best and get reliable information directly from
              the pubs themselves but I can't make guarantees!
